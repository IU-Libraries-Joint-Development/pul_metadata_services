        <p>Tucker and Henkin talk about John Addison, who became Alonzo Church's
        son-in-law. As an undergraduate at Princeton Addison became committed to
        mathematics as a result of taking Church's course in logic. Tucker tells
        how he helped bring it about that Addison did graduate work at the
        University of Wisconsin with Steve Kleene. The interviewer is William
        Aspray.</p>
